  <h2>Activities</h2>
  These are the activities I did during my freshman year in college.
  <p><strong>1. Reading Club</strong> <br> I've read books at discussion meeting called 또바기, and we have discussed a total of 8 books. Furthermore, we've conducted career exploration at the meeting. Activities are currently in progress and we will deeply discuss <u>social issues</u> during this winter vacation.
  <p><strong>2. Game-making Club</strong> <br> I was in charge of system planning in the game club, and I planned a plarform-type game. However, I had difficulty planning the system, so I switched to sound making. My team plans to make music during this winter.
  <p><strong>3. Business Simulation</strong> <br> It is an extra-curriculum activity organized by the DB Group. I've learned corporate management and entreprenuership, and I also learned how to read the market through data. <br>(I was impressed by the speaker's remark that entrepreneurs should solve social problems, and everyone should have this spirit.)
  <p><strong>4. Debating Club</strong> <br>Because I wanted to improve my english skills and logical thinking, I joined this club as soon as the semester was over. Discussion is based on the parliamentary composition and english.
  <p><strong>5. Extra</strong> <br> In addition to the above activities, I've learned conversation in English(U-phone), Excel, how to write an essay, and how to Code(instagram bot).
